Here I explain problems from homework task.

Task 1.

To write an implementation of a program which determines whether the string input has correct sequence of braces or not.
I used Stack data structure for this task.

Task 2.

To write implementation of a program which copies one Singly Linked List into another without editing/deleting the first one.

Task 3.

To write implementation of a program which finds out if Singly Linked List is sorted or not.

Attention! All data used data structures and their methods/functions are made from scratch :)
