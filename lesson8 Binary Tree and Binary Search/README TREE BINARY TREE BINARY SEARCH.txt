Here I explain problems from homework task.

Task 1.

This task is complicated enough and has several parts.
1. To create 50 binary trees with 10 000 nodes each. Each node should have a random integer number.
2. To determine whether each tree is balanced or not. 
N.B. Balanced tree is a binary tree in which the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one
3. Show the percentage of balanced trees.

Solution. 
I've created necessary data structure and methods. Used depth traverse for finding out heights.

Task 2.

To write implementation of binary search using recursion. I had to search in a binary tree.
