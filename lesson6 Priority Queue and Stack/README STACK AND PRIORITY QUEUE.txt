Here I explain problems from homework task.

Task 1.

In this task I had to implement Priority Queue with exclusion.
This type of queues work the following way:
1. If you add an element, it will join to the end of the queue.
2. The queue is not sorted neither by elements' values nor by priorities.
3. To remove an element you have to take an element with the highest priority.
   In my case, element with higher numeric value of priority has higher priority.
   Example, an element with priority 8 has higher priority than element with priority of 4.

Pay attention that implementation of data structures I made from scratch :)

Task 2.

The task was to write implementation of conversion of Decimal numbers to Binary using STACK data structure.
