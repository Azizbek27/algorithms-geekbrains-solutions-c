Here I explain problems from homework task.

Task 1.

To write an implementation of Caesar cipher. 
I had to encrypt a string and decrypt encrypted string.

Caesar cipher is an encryption of a string with a key (step).
Key shows steps to move to a certain direction in alphabet.

Example: given string - abcxyz; encrypted string with key = 3 - defabc. 

Task 2.

To implement permutation encryption.

In permutation encryption one takes a string and key (which is number of columns).
Then the string fills a table horizontally.
Encrypted string consists of merged substrings read vertically from top to down.
