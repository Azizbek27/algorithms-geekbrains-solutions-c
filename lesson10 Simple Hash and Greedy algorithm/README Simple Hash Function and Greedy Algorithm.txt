Here I explain problems from homework task.

Task 1.

To implement simple hash function.
A string is given. Print out sum of their ASCII codes.

Task 2.

Given: coins with values of 50, 10, 5, 2, 1 cents.
Implement a greedy algorithm which counts minimal number of coins to make up a certain amount.
Example: 98 cents.

Greedy algorithm is an algorithm which makes greedy decision at each iteration.
