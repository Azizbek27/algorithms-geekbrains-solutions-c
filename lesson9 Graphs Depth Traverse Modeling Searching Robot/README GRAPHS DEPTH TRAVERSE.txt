Here I explain problems from homework task.

Task 1.

To write a program which impelements depth traverse through a graph using stack and print nodes in order of traverse.
I used recursive function.
I kept solution of tutor who implemented depth traverse by using array where he stored visited vertices (nodes) of graph.

Task 2.

Modeling searching robots (such as Google or Yandex).

The task was to traverse the given graph (see the image "9.jpg" in the directory) and count edged (links) which point to
each vertice (node) in TWO following ways:

1. Using recursive function.
2. Using adjacency matrix.

And print into console results in descending order.

Solution.

I've implemented Queue structure based on Doubly Linked List with its methods in the first part of Task 2.
I used Singly Linked List for storing nodes with values (number of adjacent nodes) and sorting.

N.B. All structures and their methods are made from scratch.
